This directory contains the source of the bindlib library for
Objective-Caml (tested with version 1.07)

--------
Abstract
--------
This library provides reasonable tools to write programs manipulating
data structures with binders and variables. See the documentation 
in the doc directory.

------------
Installation
------------

This library only works with ocaml version 3.09.x., 3.10.x and after 

copy Makefile-3.09 or Makefile-3.10 to Makefile depending upon your
ocaml version

make checkconfig
  Check the guessed value of BINDIR and LIBDIR. If it does not suit you,
  edit the Makefile

make
  Compiles the library

make check
  Tests the library

make install
  To install every thing

History

Version 3.0 August 2006:

  - almost complete rewriting adding handling of variable, names and renaming
  
  - much more controled complexity thanks to a two stages construction of the
    data structures

  - simplified use thanks to a camlp4 extension

  - Still no SML version ... but I might still provide one if somone asks.

Version 2.1 January, 15th, 1998:

  - added bind_val family of functions.
  
  - added is_closed and related functions.

  - added bind_pair, bind_list and related modules

  - more complex examples available.

  - only an objective-caml version at the moment 

Version 2.0 November, 21th, 1997 (not really distributed):

  - complete rewriting (no more strange restrictions) !

  - only an objective-caml version at the moment 

Version 1.2 November, 15th, 1995:

  - Provide an SML version.

  - Correct a bug (this bug could only appear with the native 
    Caml-Special-Light compiler).

  - The function cumul-abs is not provided anymore (the library decide 
    by itself how it should optimized abstraction).

  - The price to pay: start_term can only be called while no other
    construction is already started. Another function local_start is
    provided to start a new construction of a term inside another.

Version 1.1, October, 17th, 1995:

  - Correct a major bug: when more than one variable is bound outside
    of the current sequence of binding, then the version 1.0 does not
    work at all. This bug has now been corrected.

  - The library now raises the exception "Binlib_error" instead of
    "Invalid_argument".

  - The memory usage has been optimised to take in account binder
    which binds a variable with no occurrence. In the benchmark this
    is not visible, but other examples shows an improvement of a factor
    greater than 2 !

  - The library only works for terms with less than 32768 free
    variables in each sub-term. An exception is raised if you
    use too many variables.

  - The library has now been tested on a bigger scale and should be
    more reliable (I hope)

Version 1.0, September, 27th, 1995:

  - first public version
