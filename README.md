The Bindlib library for OCaml
=============================

Bindlib is a library allowing the manipulation of data structures
with bound variables. It is particularly useful when writing ASTs
for programming languages, but also for manipulating terms of the
Î»-calculus or quantified formulas. In the internals,  binders are
represented using a form of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS).
