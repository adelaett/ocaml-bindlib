Implementation of Functional Pure Type System.  

The rule I use for PTSs are slightly modified, they type more terms,
but these extra typed terms can be reduced to be typed by the original
rules. In fact, the redex can fully plays the role of a let expression
(the abstraction does not need to be typable for the redex to be
typable).

syntax:
[a,b:X] ... for lambdas
{a,b:X} ... for Pi
A -> B  ... syntactic sugar for implication

If you want more details, look at the code and the examples given in
test.F and test.CoC.
