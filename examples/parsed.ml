(* This example illustrates the way one can convert an AST without binders (or
   the output of a parser) into an AST built using [Bindlib]. *)

open Bindlib

(* AST of the pure λ-calculus. *)

  | Var of term var
  | Abs of (term, term) binder
  | App of term * term

(* Utilities and smart constructors. *)
